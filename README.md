Unfortunately I saw proposition of internship too late. 
So I had only a few days to develop this project. I used React for the project and SASS for styles. 
I did almost all tasks but little bit of them I did another way like Add img to liked - favorited and disliked. 
Of course I can work with API, but I really didn`t have much time so I did this funcional with Locale Storage. 
I tried to do maximum tasks for this time.
